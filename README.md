# Calculator-using-Cpp
The Advanced Calculator is a C++ console application that performs basic arithmetic, conversions, and complex number operations. It allows users to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and compute exponents. It also supports degree-to-radian and radian-to-degree conversions, as well as decimal to binary, octal, and hexadecimal conversions. Additionally, the calculator handles complex number arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is designed with a user-friendly menu-driven interface and uses OOP principles to keep operations well-structured. This project is a great learning tool for mathematical computations and C++ programming.
